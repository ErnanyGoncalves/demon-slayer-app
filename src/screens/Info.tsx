He was amiable, pure of heart, and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline. He was an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young ageâ€”the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.",
